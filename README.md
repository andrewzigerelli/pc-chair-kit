# PC Chair Kit


This is a kit to make PC chairs lifes less painful.

They can be used for the following tasks:
* Conflict of interest management.
* Paper assignments.
* Various nagging tasks (prepare to nag a lot to your PCs about missed dealines and ignored guidelines).
* Managing ranking information (disclosing it to reviewers, ranking papers using PC ranks, etc)
* Meeting management (if for some reason you can't use HotCRP's awesome meeting tracker).
* Conflict of interest management for TOI awards.
